## Features Left to Implement

- HAMBURGUER MENU

## Testing

This website has been put through testing since the beginning and at every stage of the building, I made use of W3C and Jigsaw validator.
In additional, google Chrome developer tool was used for troubleshooting.

We used google Chrome developer tool & Firefox inspector tool to make sure pages are responsive to different screen sizes and devices.

All the pages were tested using Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

The lighthouse scores are very good, with some things that could be improved. A future implementation would be to convert all images to the webp format and a hamburger menu for mobile devices. 

### Validator Testing

HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

Lighthouse Scores

### Unfixed Bugs

No bugs were found, but a reduction of the payload size of the image would improve considerable the page as large network payloads cost users real money and are highly correlated with long load times.
