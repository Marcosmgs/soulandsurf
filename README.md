## Testing

This website has been put through testing since the begining and at every stage of the building, I made use of W3C and Jigsaw validator.
In additional, google Chrome developer tool was used for troubleshooting.

We used google Chrome developer tool & Firefox inspector tool to make sure pages are responsive to different screen sizes and devices.

All the pages were tested using Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

The lighthouse scores are very good, with some things that could be improved. A future implementation would be to convert all images to the webp format. 

### Validator Testing
